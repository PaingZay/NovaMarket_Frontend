# Project Introduction
This project is an e-commerce website that aims to provide a user-friendly online shopping experience for customers. It allows users to browse through products, view detailed information, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout for a secure and convenient purchase.

The website consists of both client and admin sides. On the client side, customers can explore the product catalog, search for specific items, and interact with the shopping cart functionality to manage their purchases. They can also create accounts, sign in, and access personalized features such as saved preferences and order history.

On the admin side, administrators have access to tools and functionalities for managing the e-commerce business. They can add new products, update information, manage inventory, and process customer orders. This ensures efficient order fulfillment and a smooth customer experience.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development as the frontend for the NovaMarket e-commerce website. Users can browse the product catalog, search by keywords and categories, view detailed product information, read and leave reviews, and add items to their cart for purchase. The application offers a user-friendly experience, allowing customers to easily find and review products. Please note that this project is under development, and more features will be added in the future.

## Reflection

During my two-month testing internship, I embarked on a project to develop an e-commerce website, driven by my growing passion for programming. While my internship initially focused on Quality Assurance, I realized my strong inclination towards pure programming and decided to enhance my web development skills through this project.

To begin, I devoted time to designing a robust database for the project, drawing from my previous experience leading academic group projects and collaborating within web development teams. Additionally, I delved into various frontend frameworks, selecting the most suitable one for the task at hand.

Choosing to build an e-commerce website presented an exciting challenge, allowing me to expand my skill set. One notable hurdle was creating the Spring Boot application. While the Udemy instructor advocated for a simple REST API with Spring Data Rest, I recognized its limitations for complex projects and opted for a different approach. Consequently, I took full responsibility for resolving program errors, sometimes spending days to troubleshoot and fix issues. This experience significantly improved my ability to identify and address problems efficiently.

After completing the backend Spring Boot development, I shifted my focus to building the React frontend. This phase brought forth its own set of challenges, as I learned and applied concepts in real-time. Implementing React demanded perseverance and problem-solving skills, but the process allowed me to gain valuable hands-on experience and become proficient in a short period.

Throughout this project, I've come to understand the importance of mastering essential technologies. Currently, I am focusing on honing my skills in JavaScript and Redux, as they play crucial roles in driving the project forward.
